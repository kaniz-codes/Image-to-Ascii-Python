# Image-to-Ascii-Python
This code is about using the Python to convert an image into ASCII art and save the result in a text file.

ASCII art is a form of digital art created by using characters and symbols to represent different shades of gray in an image. This code takes an input image, processes it, and produces an ASCII art representation of the image, which is then saved as a text file. It provides a simple and fun way to create artistic and textual versions of images.

  • kit.image_to_ascii_art() is a function provided by pywhatkit that converts an image to ASCII art.
  • The first argument is the path to the input image file "D:/Kaniz/Ascii/kaniz.jpg". Replace this with the path to the image you want to convert.
  • The second argument is the name of the output text file where the ASCII art will be saved, "ascii1.txt". You can change this to any desired file name and location.
